This is the reference driver implementation for <a href="http://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a>, it allows you to connect to a
Neo4j server and interact with it.
If you are using Java, this is generally the interface you'd use to integrate Neo4j in your application.

<h3>Getting Connected</h3>

<p>Once you have the driver and a connector on your classpath, you can establish sessions with Neo4j.</p>

<pre><code>Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver( "bolt://localhost", AuthTokens.basic( "neo4j", "p4ssw0rd" ) );
try( Session session = driver.session() )
{
    StatementResult result = session.run( "RETURN 'hello, world!'" );
    while( result.hasNext() )
    {
        Record record = result.next();
        System.out.println( record.get(0).asString() );
    }
}
</code></pre>

Have a look at the <a href="org/neo4j/driver/v1/Driver.html" title="interface in org.neo4j"><code>Driver</code></a>class to get started.
