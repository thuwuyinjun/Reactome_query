/**
 * A <em>Session</em> hosts a series of {@linkplain Transaction transactions}
 * carried out against a database. Within the database, all statements are
 * carried out within a transaction. Within application code, however, it is
 * not always necessary to explicitly {@link #beginTransaction() begin a
 * transaction}. If a statement is {@link #run} directly against a {@link
 * Session}, the server will automatically <code>BEGIN</code> and
 * <code>COMMIT</code> that statement within its own transaction. This type
 * of transaction is known as an <em>autocommit transaction</em>.
 * <p>
 * Explicit transactions allow multiple statements to be committed as part of
 * a single atomic operation and can be rolled back if necessary. They can also
 * be used to ensure <em>causal consistency</em>, meaning that an application
 * can run a series of queries on different members of a cluster, while
 * ensuring that each query sees the state of graph at least as up-to-date as
 * the graph seen by the previous query. For more on causal consistency, see
 * the Neo4j clustering manual.
 * <p>
 * Typically, a session will wrap a TCP connection. Such a connection will be
 * acquired from a connection pool and released back there when the session is
 * destroyed. One connection can therefore be adopted by many sessions,
 * although by only one at a time. Application code should never need to deal
 * directly with connection management.
 * <p>
 * A session inherits its destination address and permissions from its
 * underlying connection. This means that one session may only ever target one
 * machine within a cluster and does not support re-authentication. To achieve
 * otherwise requires creation of a separate session.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, multiple sessions should be used when working with concurrency;
 * session implementations are generally not thread safe.
